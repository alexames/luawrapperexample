LuaWrapper

This repository is a very simple example of how you can use LuaWrapper to
create typesafe bindings between Lua and C++. This is not a complete tutorial,
but rather just a quick project to illustrate how the library is used.
Specifically, it does not cover the hold, release or clean functions. The
source files are not well documented at this time, but should be simple enought
to follow without much trouble. More advanced examples may be put up in the
future.

If you are on a Linux system (or one of the various flavors of Unit) you should
be able to use the makefile supplied (you may need to adjust the path to the
Lua include directory). If you are Windows, you'll probably need to make a
Visual Studio solution and add the files to it. This is left as an exercise to
the reader.

To run the example once it's build, type 

    ./example example.lua
